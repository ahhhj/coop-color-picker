# coop-color-picker
To make this work, I used XAMPP with apache and mysqli (and php? I don't know if that can be chosen or not) and had:

  a database in mysql called "test" with a table "color" in it, with the columns id,red,green,blue,alpha

  all of these files added in xampp\htdocs
  
  RobotoMono-Regular.ttf added in that same directory

this is so bad I know but it doesn't need to be good
